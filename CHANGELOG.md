- **Floating animation:** 5s ease-in-out infinite for business cards, 4s for personal links
- **Hover effect:** `translate3d(0, -3px, 10px)` with bounce easing `cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1)`
- **Responsive grid:** `auto-fit, minmax(280px, 1fr)` for business cards

- **Performance:** ~15KB HTML, GPU-accelerated animations, inline everything

### Design Philosophy
- Inspired by Apple, Nike, Stripe, and BAUHAUS principles
- Minimal, timeless aesthetic - no AI-generated look
- Spatial architecture - elements float off black wall surface

- 3D depth perception - hover extrusion like bricks sliding from wall
- Strict geometric precision - clean rectangles, consistent spacing

### Content Updates
- Simplified bio to "Entrepreneur • Dallas, TX"
- Business descriptions updated for clarity
- Added "Connect" header to personal links section

- Semantic HTML with proper ARIA labels
- Tab navigation through all links
- Reduced motion support via media query

### Files Modified

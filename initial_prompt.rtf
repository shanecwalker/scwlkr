\f0\fs24 \cf0 # WEBSITE OVERHAUL\
\
\'97\
\
## This website is an old washed up link in bio site that I set up a while ago. It is time for a big update! One that makes the site unique and stand out! your sole job is to focus on keeping this website extremely fast while making it unique and truly different from the rest, a stand out eccentric design. Something new, something that people have not seen before!\

\
## Purpose of this website\
 \
- the reason for this website is to be a home base for all of my projects/businesses \
- the site should be intuitive and impressively simple\
- the site should update with all of my businesses as logos change etc. \
- the site should host all the links to all of my socials and any places where I can be found online\
- the site should be clean with no gradients, and nothing that looks AI generated or triggers people to think AI made the website\

\
## Website Design\
\
- The website should feel like a blank wall with no buttons, but when you hover over something it should feel like a brick sliding out of that wall and protrude from it.\
- the businesses should be in card formats but feel almost like they\'92re gently floating, not sporadically but in perfect alignment and with order. They should not move a lot just enough to slightly notice\
- the website should have a clean minimal feel, always avoiding current trends or fads, but instead looking deep into perfect seamless design like apple, nike, stripe, BAUHAUS\
- the site should host my businesses in a more central larger way with most of the attention going to them, and my personal links should take up less space\
